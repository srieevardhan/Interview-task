# Bubble Sort Visualizer

## 🚀 Live Demo

🔗 **Live Application:**  
https://sort-theta.vercel.app/


## Bubble Sort Explanation
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
This process continues until the array becomes fully sorted.

## How the Visualizer Works
- Generates a random array (10–20 elements)
- Displays values as vertical bars
- Colors indicate:
  - Blue: Unsorted
  - Red: Currently comparing
  - Green: Sorted
- Sorting is animated step by step using delays

## Tech Stack
- React (Frontend only)
- JavaScript
- CSS

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`

## Restrictions Followed
- No built-in sorting functions
- No animation libraries
- Manual Bubble Sort logic
